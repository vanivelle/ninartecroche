/**
 * SMS NOTIFICATION ROUTE
 * 
 * Status: ⏳ READY BUT AWAITING TWILIO APPROVAL
 * 
 * This route sends SMS notifications when a contact form is submitted.
 * Currently, it's configured and ready, but will only work once Twilio
 * approves the account (5-7 business days from creation).
 * 
 * What happens:
 * 1. User submits contact form
 * 2. Email is sent immediately (via send-email route)
 * 3. SMS notification is sent in parallel to +1 (860) 709-7832
 * 4. If SMS fails (account not approved yet), email still works
 * 
 * Expected timeline:
 * - Account created: March 14, 2026
 * - Expected approval: March 21-28, 2026
 * - SMS notifications will auto-start after approval (no code changes needed)
